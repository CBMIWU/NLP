<h3>Project Description 
==
The goal of the clinical and translational research is to rapidly convert novel advances in basic science to improvements in patient care and relay findings from clinical studies employing such new and increasingly customized diagnostics and therapeutics back to the bench for further refinement of the disease management process. To realize this goal, the physician-scientist must be able to integrate diverse and complex biomedical data sets that include clinical information obtained from the patient with the results of routine laboratory tests, imaging, biospecimens, molecular profiling (e.g. microarray analysis, proteomics, lipidomics, etc.), and genome annotation information. Cider NLP project facilitate and encourage developing of new annotator, pipeline, collaborate on biomedical natural language processing systems and develop gold-standard corpora for development and testing. We have use open source UIMA framework as the basis for CIDER NLP project.

<h3>Why Use CIDER NLP ?
==
The clinical and translational research creates, manages and uses a wide variety of structured and unstructured documents which could be in either reports in the textual formats. To perform research, to improve standards and to evaluate outcomes easily and ideally, in an automated fashion access to the content of these textual documents are required. The knowledge contained in structured  and unstructured documents (e.g. Surgical path or lab reports, pathology reports, clinical notes, etc.), is critical to achieving all of these goals. CIDER NLP software extracts structured information from these unstructure doccuments like reports, facilitating much faster research solution. 
E.g. We have successfully implemented and are using CIDER NLP to search use of Illicit Drugs from the Medical Documents.

<h3>What is NLP ?
==
(Wikipedia definition)
Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humanâ€“computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation.
